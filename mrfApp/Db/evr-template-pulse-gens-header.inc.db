# Pulse generator registers.

# This configuration is for the pulse generators of the VME-EVR-230RF (firmware
# version 12000006). This device has 16 pulse generators, which all have a
# 32-bit delay and a 16-bit pulse width. The first four pulse generators also 
# have an 8-bit prescaler. The VME-EVR-230 most likely has the same features.
# However, due to the lack of a device to test on, this could not be verified.
# The test for checking the number of pulse generators and their supported
# features is writing 0xffffffff to the corresponding registers. The bits of 
# registers, that are supported are set to one, while the other bits remain
# zero. This way, the width of supported registers can be determined, too.
# Caution: The VME-EVR-230RF supports the register addresses for pulse
# generators 16 to 31. However, they actually refer to the same memory as pulse
# generators 0 to 15. Therefore, these addresses should not be used.

# Number of pulse generators. This number depends on exact hardware and firmware
# version.
