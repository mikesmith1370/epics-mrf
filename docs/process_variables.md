List of process variables
=========================

When using the database files that are provided as part of the device support,
process variables for controlling and monitoring nearly every aspect of the EVG
and EVR are provided.

The exact list of process variables depends on the device type (different form
factors or hardware revisions have different features), but most of the process
variables described here should be available for the majority of the devices.

The process variables listed here are specified without any prefix, so the
device specific prefix (the combination of the `P` and `R` macros
[specified in the IOC's startup file](using.md)) has to be added to the names
specified here.

### AC synchronization

<table>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ACSync:ByPassDividerAndShift</td>
<td>Divider and phase-shifter by-pass flag. If enabled (1), the phase shifter and divider are bypassed. This means that the respective settings do not have any effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ACSync:Divider</td>
<td>Divider for the AC sync logic. The AC frequency (usually 50 Hz) is divided by this number, reducing the frequency of the AC sync trigger. For example, a divider of 50 with an input of 50 Hz results in one AC sync event every second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ACSync:MapTo:EvTrig#</td>
<td>Mapping of AC sync logic to event trigger #. If 1, the AC sync event is mapped to the respective event trigger (sending the event code associated with that trigger). If 0, the respective mapping is disable. # usually has to be a number between 0 and 7.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ACSync:PhaseShift</td>
<td>Phase shift for the AC sync logic. This can be used to shift the AC sync event w.r.t. to the phase of the AC sync input.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ACSync:SyncSource</td>
<td>Synchronization source of the AC sync logic. If 0, the AC sync event is generated at the event cycle when the AC sync logic triggers. If 1, a trigger of the AC sync logic is delayed until multiplexed counter 7 has counted down. This can be used to ensure that the AC sync event is coincidental with some other clock (which should typically be much larger than the AC input frequency).</td>

### Inputs

Typically, there are three types of inputs: Front-panel inputs, front-panel
universal inputs, and transition-board universal inputs. Which types of inputs
are available and the number of inputs depends on the exact hardware model.
Front-panel inputs use the PV prefix `FPIn#`, where # is the number of the input
(starting at zero). Front-panel universal inputs use the PV prefix `UnivIn#`,
where # is the number of the input (starting at zero). Transition-board
universal inputs use the PV prefix `TBIn#`, where # is the number of the input
(starting at zero).

In the following table, all PVs are listed with the generic PV prefix `In`,
which has to be replaced with the input-specific prefix.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In:Installed</td>

### Interrupts

The details of the interrupt handling depend on the hardware type. For hardware
that is accessed using the Linux device driver, interrupts are supported
directly and should thus usually occur with minimal delay. When accessing the
hardware over the UDP/IP protocol, on the other hand, the interrupt status has
to be polled and thus there can be significant delays.

When a device is accessed using the Linux device driver, it is only updated when an interrupt occurs. Only those interrupts which are actually enabled can have their bits set to one. Due to the volatile nature of this process variable, the process variables representing individual interrupt flags should be preferred.</td>

<td>Writing to this record resets all multiplexed counters. This is usually done after configuring all mutiplexed counters in order to ensure that they have a fixed phase w.r.t. to each other.</td>
</tr>
</table>


### Outputs

Typically, there are two types of outputs: Front-panel outputs and front-panel
universal outputs. Which types of outputs are available and the number of
outputs depends on the exact hardware model. Front-panel outputs use the PV
prefix `FPOut#`, where # is the number of the output (starting at zero).
Front-panel universal outputs use the PV prefix `UnivOut#`, where # is the
number of the output (starting at zero).

In the following table, all PVs are listed with the generic PV prefix `Out`,
which has to be replaced with the output-specific prefix.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>

### SFP module

The following PVs provide diagnostics information about the SFP module that is
installed inside the EVG. Please note that some of the information is optional
and not all SFP modules might provide it. In that case, the respective PVs will

### Event mapping RAM

There are two mapping RAMs (mapping RAM 0 and 1). The following list uses the
generic prefix `MapRAM#` for all records that are specific to a certain mapping
RAM. Replace this prefix with `MapRAM0` or `MapRAM1` in order to get the actual
PV name.

Please note that the the last two PVs in the list apply to both mapping RAMs and
thus do not use a mapping RAM specific prefix.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MapRAM#:InternalFunctions</td>
<td>Mapping of event codes to internal functions. This is an array containing one element for each event code. Each element is a bitset where each bit represents an internal function that can be triggered by an event.

</table>


### Event clock

<table>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>EventClock:Freq</td>
<td>Frequency of the event clock. This frequency only has to fit roughly because it is only used for estimating the length of a microsecond in event clock cycles. For example, this information is used by the heartbeat watchdog.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>EventClock:Gen:Freq</td>
<td>Frequency generated by the internal frequency generator (Micrel SY87739L). The frequency is not specified directly. Instead, one has to choose from a list of preconfigured frequencies.

</tr>
<tr>
<td>TX:Loopback</td>
<td>Transmitter loopback flag. If 0, the transmitter operates normally (sends events and distributed bus bits possibly modified by this EVR). If 1, the signal received from an upstream EVG or EVR is directly looped back into the transmitter, thus transmitting the signal to a downstream EVG or EVR without any modifications.</td>

### Inputs

In the following table, all PVs are listed without the generic PV prefix `In`,
which has to be replaced with an input-specific prefix (e.g. `FPIn0` for
front-panel input 0, `FPIn1` for front-panel input 1, etc.). The number of
available inputs depends on the form-factor and hardware revision.

<table>

</table>


### Interrupts

The details of the interrupt handling depend on the hardware type. For hardware
that is accessed using the Linux device driver, interrupts are supported
directly and should thus usually occur with minimal delay. When accessing the
hardware over the UDP/IP protocol, on the other hand, the interrupt status has
to be polled and thus there can be significant delays.

<table>

When a device is accessed using the Linux device driver, it is only updated when an interrupt occurs. Only those interrupts which are actually enabled can have their bits set to one. Due to the volatile nature of this process variable, the process variables representing individual interrupt flags should be preferred.</td>
</tr>

</table>


### Outputs

Typically, there are three types of outputs: Front-panel outputs, front-panel
universal outputs, and transition board outputs. Which types of outputs are
available and the number of outputs depends on the exact hardware model.

Front-panel outputs use the PV prefix `FPOut#`, where # is the number of the
output (starting at zero). Front-panel universal outputs use the PV prefix
`UnivOut#`, where # is the number of the output (starting at zero).
Transition-board universal outputs use the PV prefix `TBOut#`, where # is the
number of the output (starting at zero).

In the following table, all PVs are listed with the generic PV prefix `Out`,
which has to be replaced with the output-specific prefix.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Out:Installed</td>
<td>Installed flag (read only). This flag is only available for universal outputs. The flag is 1 if the respective universal output module is installed and 0 if it is not installed. Please note that this information is not read from the hardware, but specified in the IOC startup configuration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Out:Map</td>
<td>Mapping used for the output. A value of 0 to 31 specifies that the corresponding pulse generator shall be used. A value of 32 to 39 specifies that one of the distributed bus bits (32 meaning distributed bus bit 0 and 39 meaning distributed bus bit 7) shall be used. A value of 40 to 42 specifies that one of the prescalers (40 meaning prescaler 0 and 42 meaning prescaler 2) shall be used. A value of 62 specified that the output shall be set to constant hight. A value of 63 specifies that the output shall be set to constant low.</td>
</tr>
</table>

For CML outputs, there is a number of additional PVs that configure the CML
operation:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Out:Enabled</td>
<td>Output enable flag. If 1, the output is enabled. If 0, the output is disabled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Out:FreqMode:HighPeriod</td>
<td>High period for the frequency mode. This specifies the number of CML clock cycles (event clock mutiplied by twenty) for which the output is pulled high. Must be between 20 and 65535.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Out:FreqMode:LowPeriod</td>
<td>Low period for the frequency mode. This specifies the number of CML clock cycles (event clock mutiplied by twenty) for which the output is pulled low. Must be between 20 and 65535.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Out:FreqMode:TrigLevel</td>
<td>Output level when output is triggered. If 0, the output starts in the low state when triggered and later switches to the high state. If 1, the output starts in the high state when triggered and later switches to the low state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Out:FreqMode:TrigPosition</td>
<td>Offset period when output is triggered (in CML clock cycles). The counter measuring the time the output has been in a certain state is initialized to this value when the output is triggered. This effectively changes the phase of the generated signal, because the switch to the oppositve output state will happen earlier when this value is not zero.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Out:Mode</td>
<td>Output mode select. 0 for pulse mode, 1 for frequency mode, and 2 for pattern mode.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Out:PatternMode:Recycle</td>
<td>Pattern recycle flag. If enabled (1), the output again starts with the first sample when the specified number of samples has been used. If disabled (0), the output stays in the state specified by the last sample until the output is triggered again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Out:PatternMode:Samples</td>
<td>Samples for the pattern mode. This is an array of 2048 elements, each element representing a bitfield. Only the lower 20 bits are used, the upper 12 bits are unused. Each of the 20 bits represents one sample (1 for high and 0 for low) that is used by the CML output. The CML output uses the bits at a rate of 20 times the event clock, thus resulting in one sample (up to 20 different states) being output with each event clock cycle. When modifying this array, only changed elements are actually sent to the hardware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Out:PatternMode:Samples:WriteAll</td>
<td>Writing to this record causes all elements of the <code>Out:PatternMode:Samples</code> array to be written to the hardware.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Out:PulseMode:Falling</td>
<td>Pattern used in pulse mode for the falling edge state. This is a bit-set where only the lower 20 bits are used. Those bits represent the 20 states that are used for the output at the CML clock rate (20 times the event clock rate) when a falling edge condition is detected. A falling edge condition is detected when the signal mapped to the output was high during the last event clock cycle and is low during the current event clock cycle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Out:PulseMode:High</td>
<td>Pattern used in pulse mode for the high state. This is a bit-set where only the lower 20 bits are used.

A low condition is detected when the signal mapped to the output was low during the last event clock cycle and is also low during the current event clock cycle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Out:PulseMode:Rising</td>
<td>Pattern used in pulse mode for the rising edge state. This is a bit-set where only the lower 20 bits are used. Those bits represent the 20 states that are used for the output at the CML clock rate (20 times the event clock rate) when a rising edge condition is detected. A rising edge condition is detected when the signal mapped to the output was low during the last event clock cycle and is high during the current event clock cycle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Out:Reset</td>
<td>Output reset flag. If 1, the output is forced to be reset. If 0, the output shall operate normally.</td>
</tr>
</table>


### Pulse generators

The number of available pulse generators depends on the form-factor and hardware
revision. Even within one device, different pulse generators might have
different features (e.g. prescaler available / not available, allowed range of
the pulse delay and width). Please refer to the EVR manual for details regarding
the features of a specific device.

In the following table, the generic prefix `PulseGen#` is used for PVs that are
specific to a certain pulse generator. # has to be replaced by the number of the
pulse generator (starting at zero) in order to get the actual PV name.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NumPulseGen</td>
<td>Number of pulse generators supported by the device.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PulseGen#:Delay</td>
<td>Pulse delay (in event clock cycles).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PulseGen#:Enabled</td>
<td>Enabled flag. If 0, the pulse generator is disabled. If 1, it is enabled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PulseGen#:MapResetEnabled</td>
<td>Allow mapping of reset event flag. If enabled (1), the mapping RAM may cause the pulse generator to be reset. If disabled (0), such a mapping is ignored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PulseGen#:MapSetEnabled</td>
<td>Allow mapping of set event flag. If enabled (1), the mapping RAM may cause the pulse generator to be set. If disabled (0), such a mapping is ignored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PulseGen#:MapTrigEnabled</td>
<td>Allow mapping of trigger event flag. If enabled (1), the mapping RAM may cause the pulse generator to be triggered. If disabled (0), such a mapping is ignored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PulseGen#:Polarity</td>
<td>Polarity. If 0, the pulse generator has normal polarity. This means that the outputs using the pulse generator are set to the same state as the pulse generator. If 1, the pulse generator has inverse polarity. This means that the outputs using the pulse generator use the inverse state of the pulse generator. A low state of the pulse generator causes a high state of the outputs and a high state of the pulse generator causes a low state of the outputs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PulseGen#:Prescaler</td>
<td>Prescaler divider. This record is typically only available for a few of the pulse generators. The prescaler divider scales down the clock used for the delay and width counters. Instead of using the event clock, the specified fraction of the event clock is used. This effectively increases the range of the pulse delay and width.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PulseGen#:Reset</td>
<td>Writing to this record cause the pulse generator to be reset (put into the low state).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PulseGen#:Set</td>
<td>Writing to this record cause the pulse generator to be set (put into the low state).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PulseGen#:Status</td>
<td>Current state of the pulse generator (read-only). A value of 0 means low and a value of 1 means high. This record is not updated automatically. Process it (write 0 to the <code>PROC</code> field) in order to get the latest status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PulseGen#:Width</td>
<td>Pulse width (in event clock cycles). After being triggered, the pulse generator stays in the high state for the specified number of event clock cycles and then switches to the low state.</td>
</tr>

### Prescalers

The number of prescalers and their width may depend on the form factor and
hardware revision. Most devices have three prescalers, each having a width of at
least 16-bits.

In the following table, the generic prefix `Prescaler#` is used for PVs that are
specific to a certain prescaler. # has to be replaced by the number of the
prescaler (starting at zero) in order to get the actual PV name.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prescaler#</td>
<td>Divider used by prescaler #. The divider specifies the rate at which prescaler # runs. The rate is derived from the event clock rate. For example, at an event clock rate of 125 MHz, a divider of 5 would result in a prescaler that runs at 25 MHz.</td>
</tr>
</table>


### Time stamps

The time-stamp mechanism allows for a high-precision time-stamp being
distributed from an EVG to all EVRs. The details of this mechanism are tricky,
so it is strongly suggested that you refer to the EVG and EVR manuals for a
detailed description.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TimeStamp:EventCounter</td>
<td>Time-stamp event counter (read-only). The event counter is incremented depending on the event counter prescaler and event counter source. If the event counter prescaler is non-zero, the event clock is divided by the prescaler factor and the resulting clock increments the event counter with each cycle. If the event counter prescaler is zero, the behavior depends on the event counter source. If the event counter source is set to distributed bus bit 4, the event counter is incremented with each rising edge of that bus bit. If the event counter source is set to event code 0x7C, the event counter is incremented each time that event (or another event mapped to the time-stamp clock event internal function) is received. The event counter is reset to zero when the reset time-stamp event (event code 0x7D) or another event mapped to the respective internal function is received. This record is not updated automatically. Process it (write 0 to the <code>PROC</code> field) in order to get the latest status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TimeStamp:EventCounterPrescaler</td>
<td>Event counter clock prescaler. If non-zero, the event counter is incremented with each n<sup>th</sup> even clock cycle where n is the number specified for the prescaler.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TimeStamp:EventCounterSource</td>
<td>Event counter source. This setting is only effective if the the event counter prescaler is set to zero. In this case, a setting of 0 specifies distributed bus bit as the trigger source for the event counter and a setting of 1 specifies event code 0x7C (or any other event mapped to the time-stamp clock event internal function) as the trigger source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TimeStamp:EventLatch</td>
<td>Time-stamp event latch (read-only). The latch is updated with the current value of the time-stamp event counter (the current value in the hardware, not in EPICS) when an event that is mapped to the latch time-stamp internal function is received. This record is not updated automatically. Process it (write 0 to the <code>PROC</code> field) in order to get the latest status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TimeStamp:Latch</td>
<td>Writing to this record has the same effect as if an event mapped to the latch time-stamp internal function was received.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TimeStamp:Reset</td>
<td>Writing to this record has the same effect as if the reset time-stamp event (event code 0x7D) or another event mapped to the respective internal function was received.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TimeStamp:SecondsCounter</td>
<td>Time-stamp seconds counter (read-only). The time-stamp seconds counter contains the value that the time-stamp seconds shift register had when the last time-stamp reset event occurred. This record is not updated automatically. Process it (write 0 to the <code>PROC</code> field) in order to get the latest status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TimeStamp:SecondsLatch</td>
<td>Time-stamp seconds latch (read-only). The latch is updated with the current value of the time-stamp seconds counter (the current value in the hardware, not in EPICS) when an event that is mapped to the latch time-stamp internal function is received. This record is not updated automatically. Process it (write 0 to the <code>PROC</code> field) in order to get the latest status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TimeStamp:SecondsShift</td>
<td>Time-stamp seconds shift register (read-only). The time-stamp seconds shift register is updated when a "seconds shift register 0" event (event code 0x70) or a "seconds shift register 1" event (event code 0x71) is received. The value of this register is the source used when updating the time-stamp seconds counter.  This record is not updated automatically. Process it (write 0 to the <code>PROC</code> field) in order to get the latest status.</td>
</tr>

### SFP module

The PVs with diagnostic information for the SFP module are exactly the same as
[the ones supported for the EVG](#sfp-module).
