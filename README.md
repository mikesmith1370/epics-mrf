EPICS device support for MRF EVR and EVG
========================================

This EPICS device support is intended for use with the event generator (EVG) and
event receiver (EVR) devices that are part of the timing system from
[Microresearch Finland (MRF)](http://www.mrf.fi/).

At the moment, the following devices are directly supported:

- MTCA-EVR-300
- VME-EVR-230
- VME-EVR-230RF

This device support implements an abstraction layer, that allows it to control
devices either via PCI(e) (using the MRF linux kernel driver) or via Ethernet,
using a UDP/IP based protocol. The second option is only available for those
devices that actually support being controlled via Ethernet (these are all the
VME based devices).

This device support only works with devices using the “new” (modular register
map) firmware, not with devices using the legacy firmware.

Ready-to-use panels for Control System Studio for the aforementioned devices are
supplied with this device support.
